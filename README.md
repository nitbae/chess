# chess
This repository contains my entertaining thing (not a serious project).
It is like a single chess game where you can play against the engine. It may be some changes later)

In first, I'm going to create like vision for every type of pieces - moves that player is allowed to do by this piece.
There is a lot of ways to implement this and I have already gone one:
        - Doing classes according to pieces
        - Doing helping class at the same time to make some features usable
        - Into the every class creating funcs returning list of all possible moves from given position

So, to my mind, next one is implementation of the classes system with parsing player's instrustion firstly. This system have to identify requested piece like an object.

README is changing according to new ideas!
